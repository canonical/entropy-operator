# Pollen

More information: https://charmhub.io/pollen

Pollen is a scalable, high performance, free software (AGPL) web server, that
provides small strings of entropy, over TLS-encrypted HTTPS or clear text HTTP
connections. You might think of this as 'Entropy-as-a-Service'. This charm
deploys a Pollen server.
